# DP 201 - Designing an Azure Data Platform Solution.
# Lab 5 - Designing for Scale and Resiliency.

**Estimated Time**: 60 minutes

**Pre-requisites**: It is assumed that the case study for this lab has already been read.

## Legend  
👩‍🏫 = Whiteboard Activity  
📄 = Complete a Document Activity

## Lab overview

The students will explore a range of resiliency and scale issues that would have to be considered when defining a solution architecture for an organization. They will first look at how they will incorporate scale into a solution. They will follow this by looking into storage and database performance, and how solutions can be made highly available. Finally, the student will investigate the issue of disaster recovery.

## Lab objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Adjust Workload Capacity by Scaling
1. Design for Optimized Storage and Database Performance
1. Design a Highly Available Solution
1. Incorporate Disaster Recovery into Architectures

## Scenario
  
You have recently been hired as a senior data engineer at AdventureWorks and are working with a consultant and architects to design a resilience and scale approach for a cloud data platform solution that meets the organizations technical and business requirements.

Based on the case study about AdventureWorks, you have been asked by the board to produce a short report that address their concerns regarding the resilience and scaling of the services to meet with the websites ability to process sales and the customers demand for service. The report should confirm the concerns that has been raised, and your report should propose how the issues are to be dealt with.

You should also address the concerns of how the organization should maintain operations in the event of intermittent failures. It should also address a disaster recovery approach to ensure the data is protected.

At the end of this lab, you will have:

1. Adjust Workload Capacity by Scaling
1. Design for Optimized Storage and Database Performance
1. Design a Highly Available Solution
1. Incorporate Disaster Recovery into Architectures

>**Resources**: As well as the using the course case study for this lab, you use also use resources such a [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com), the [Azure Reference Architecture Site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/) and the [Microsoft Customer Stories Site](https://customers.microsoft.com/) to help inform you in answering questions in this lab.

## Exercise 1: Adjust Workload Capacity by Scaling

**Group exercise**
  
1. From the case study, list out the services that would benefit from scaling and how the scale units are measured per service.

### Task 1: 📄 List the scaling requirements for AdventureWorks

1. From your machine, open up the file [DP-201-Lab05_Ex01_Ta01.docx](../Labfiles/Starter/DP-201.5/DP-201-Lab05_Ex01_Ta01.docx)

2. As a group, spend **15 minutes** discussing and documenting the services that would benefit from scaling for AdventureWorks. Provide justification for the decision and evidence should be provided from the case study.

3. Define how the scale units are measured per service.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created a Microsoft Word document that shows scale requirements for AdventureWorks.

## Exercise 2: Design for Optimized Storage and Database Performance

**Group exercise**
  
1. Define service feature that can be used to optimize storage and database performance.

### Task 1: 📄 Define the primary authentication mechanism for each technology used to meet AdventureWorks requirements.

1. From your machine, open up the file [DP-201-Lab05_Ex02_Ta01.docx](/Labfiles/Starter/DP-201.5/DP-201-Lab05_Ex02_Ta01.docx) 

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** listing the features of the services identified in exercise one that can fulfill the business requirements.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you will create a document that defines service feature that can be used to optimize storage and database performance.

## Exercise 3: Design a Highly Available Solution

**Group exercise**
  
The main task for this exercise is as follows:

1. Define service feature that provide high availability where possible.

### Task 1: 📄 Define service feature that provide high availability where possible.

1. From your machine, open up the file [DP-201-Lab05_Ex03_Ta01.docx](/Labfiles/Starter/DP-201.5/DP-201-Lab05_Ex03_Ta01.docx) 

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** listing the features of the services identified in exercise one that can fulfill the business requirements. Also note any services that cannot provide availability.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you will create a document that defines service feature that provide high availability.

## Exercise 4: Incorporate Disaster Recovery into Architectures

**Group exercise**
  
1. Outline the Disaster Recovery approach for the data services used by AdventureWorks.

### Task 1: 📄 Outline the Disaster Recovery approach for the data services used by AdventureWorks.

1. From your machine, open up the file [DP-201-Lab05_Ex04_Ta01.docx](/Labfiles/Starter/DP-201.5/DP-201-Lab05_Ex04_Ta01.docx) 

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** documenting the disaster recovery requirements for AdventureWorks using the case study as reference.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you will create a document that defines the disaster recovery requirements for AdventureWorks.

## Lab Review

After approximately 60 minutes, the instructor will bring a close to this lab. The class will discuss the findings of each group.
