# DP 201 - Designing an Azure Data Platform Solution.
# Lab 2 - Azure Batch Processing Reference Architectures.

**Estimated Time**: 60 minutes

**Pre-requisites**: It is assumed that the case study for this lab has already been read.

## Legend  
👩‍🏫 = Whiteboard Activity  
📄 = Complete a Document Activity

## Lab overview

The students will use the case study to identify which business and technical requirements relate to a **Lambda architecture** from a **batch mode** perspective. The student will then: 
- architect an enterprise BI solution
- add automation to the architecture. 
- design Bot architecture that focuses on the data stores that would be required to support such a solution 

## Lab objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Design an Enterprise BI solution in Azure
2. Automate enterprise BI solutions in Azure
3. Architect an Enterprise-grade conversational bot in Azure

## Scenario
  
You are the senior data engineer of AdventureWorks. You are designing and architecting a solution that will deal with the batch mode processing of data. You have been advised that the solution architecture should take a holistic view of all the business requirements and your proposal should be presented in a Word document.

You will first define which aspect of the AdventureWorks requirements fits into batch mode processing of a Lambda architecture. You will then provide an architecture for an enterprise BI solution in Azure and think of ways that the solution can be automated. You will also design a first pass on an AI architecture.

At the end of this lab, you will have:

1. Design an Enterprise BI solution in Azure
2. Automate enterprise BI solutions in Azure
3. Architect an Enterprise-grade conversational bot in Azure

>**Resources**: As well as the using the course case study for this lab, you use also use resources such a [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com), the [Azure Reference Architecture Site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/) and the [Microsoft Customer Stories Site](https://customers.microsoft.com/) to help inform you in answering questions in this lab. 

## Exercise 1: Design an Enterprise BI solution in Azure

**Group exercise**
  
1. From the case study, identify the requirements that would form part of the **Batch mode processing** of data in an Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks.

1. Build a high level Architecture that reflects the Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks.

### Task 1: 📄 List batch mode processing requirements for AdventureWorks

1. From your machine, open up the file [DP-201-Lab02_Ex01_Ta01.docx](../Labfiles/Starter/DP-201.2/DP-201-Lab02_Ex01_Ta01.docx)

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** discussing and listing the requirements that would form part of the Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks. Evidence should be provided from the case study.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created a Microsoft Word document that shows a table of security requirements for AdventureWorks.

### Task 2: 👩‍🏫 Build a high level Architecture that reflects the Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks. 

1. Go to the whiteboard

1. As a group, spend **20 minutes** discussing and diagraming the architectures that would form part of the Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks.
2. Include also any automation solution you see fit for the Enterprise BI

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created architectures that would form part of the Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks.

## Exercise 2: Conversational bot solutions in Azure

**Group exercise**
  
1. Amend a high level Architecture to include automation of a conversational bot solution in AdventureWorks.

### Task 1: 👩‍🏫 Architect an Enterprise-grade conversational bot in Azure

1. Review your BI Architecture on the whiteboard

2. As a group, spend **10 minutes** discussing and diagraming the architectures that would form part of an Enterprise-grade conversational bot in  AdventureWorks. You can use the png files in the icon folder to build your architecture.

> **Hint**: Only a simple architecture that deals with bot conversations is required

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created an architecture to include an Enterprise-grade conversational bot in Azure.

## Lab Review

After approximately 60 minutes, the instructor will bring a close to this lab. The class will discuss the findings of each group.
