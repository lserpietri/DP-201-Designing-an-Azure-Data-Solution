## Lab overview

The students will use the information gained in this module and apply it to a scenario that is defined in a case study about AdventureWorks. They will describe and provide examples of how the core principles for creating architectures will be applied to AdventureWorks. This will include designing with security in mind. They will also provide specific examples of how to design performance and scalability within a solution. The students will also describe the availability and recoverability options that are needed by the organization. Finally, the student will identify the efficiency and operations opportunities that can be gained by the options

## Lab objectives
  
1. Design with Security in Mind
2. Design for Performance and Scalability
3. Design for Availability and Recoverability
4. Design for Efficiency and Operations

## Scenario
  
You have recently been hired as a senior data engineer at AdventureWorks and are working with a consultant and architects to design a cloud data platform solution that meets the organizations technical and business requirements.

Working in a group, you will be performing a discovery exercise – via a case study - with the consultant and architects. Firstly, to understand AdventureWorks organizational goals. Secondly to articulate and provide examples of the architectural aspects that the team must be aware of as they construct the solution architectures. The architectural aspects include security, performance, scalability, availability, recoverability, efficiency and operations.

At the end of this lab, you will have:

1. Design with Security in Mind
2. Design for Performance and Scalability
3. Design for Availability and Recoverability
4. Design for Efficiency and Operations

>**Resources**: As well as the using the course case study for this lab, you use also use resources such a [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com), the [Azure Reference Architecture Site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/) and the [Microsoft Customer Stories Site](https://customers.microsoft.com/) to help inform you in answering questions in this lab. 

## Exercise 1: Design with Security in Mind

**Group exercise**
  
The main task for this exercise is as follows:

1. From the case study, identify the security requirements of AdventureWorks.

### Task 1: 📄 Identify the security requirements of AdventureWorks.

1. From your machine, open up the file [DP-201-Lab01.docx](../Labfiles/Starter/DP-201.1/DP-201-Lab01.docx)

2. As a group, spend **15 minutes** discussing and listing the security requirements that your group has identified within the case study document. Evidence should be provided from the case study.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created a Microsoft Word document that shows a table of security requirements for AdventureWorks.

## Exercise 2: Design for Performance and Scalability
  
**Group exercise**
  
The main task for this exercise are as follows:

1. Determine the performance and scalability requirements as identify from the case study.

### Task 1: 📄 Identify the performance and scalability requirements of AdventureWorks.

1. Continue to work on the file [DP-201-Lab01.docx](../Labfiles/Starter/DP-201.1/DP-201-Lab01.docx)

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** discussing and listing the performance and scalability requirements that your group has identified within the case study document. Evidence should be provided from the case study.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have added to the Microsoft Word document that shows a table of requirements for AdventureWorks.

## Exercise 3: Design for Availability and Recoverability
  
**Group exercise**
  
The main task for this exercise are as follows:

1. Determine the availability and recoverability requirements as identify from the case study.

### Task 1: 📄 Identify the availability and recoverability requirements of AdventureWorks.

1. Continue to work on the file [DP-201-Lab01.docx](../Labfiles/Starter/DP-201.1/DP-201-Lab01.docx)

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** discussing and listing the availability and recoverability requirements that your group has identified within the case study document. Evidence should be provided from the case study.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have added to the Microsoft Word document that shows a table of requirements for AdventureWorks.

## Exercise 4: Design for Efficiency and Operations
  
**Group exercise**
  
The main task for this exercise are as follows:

1. Determine the efficiency and operations requirements for AdventureWorks.

### Task 1: 📄 Identify the efficiency and operations requirements of AdventureWorks.

1. Continue to work on the file [DP-201-Lab01.docx](../Labfiles/Starter/DP-201.1/DP-201-Lab01.docx)

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** discussing and listing the efficiency and operations requirements that your group has identified within the case study document. Evidence should be provided from the case study.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have added to the Microsoft Word document that shows a table of requirements for AdventureWorks.

## Lab Review

After approximately 60 minutes, the instructor will bring a close to this lab. The class will discuss the findings of each group.
