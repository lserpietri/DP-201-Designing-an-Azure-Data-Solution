# DP 201 - Designing an Azure Data Platform Solution.
# Lab 4 - Azure Data Platform Security Considerations

**Estimated Time**: 50 minutes

**Pre-requisites**: It is assumed that the case study for this lab has already been read.

## Legend  
👩‍🏫 = Whiteboard Activity  
📄 = Complete a Document Activity

## Lab overview

The students will explore the range of security options that are available to provide a defence in depth approach to securing the AdventureWorks environment. This will include investigating the available network protection options that are available, as well as the authentication mechanisms that are support by each service. The students will also understand the encryption options that are available and demonstrate an understanding of network level and application level protection.

## Lab objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Defense in Depth Security Approach
1. Identity Management

## Scenario
  
You have recently been hired as a senior data engineer at AdventureWorks and are working with a consultant and architects to design a security approach for cloud data platform solution that meets the organizations technical and business requirements.

Working in a group, you will be performing a security assessment of the architectures that have been defined so that there is a defense in depth approach to securing the environment. Firstly, you will create a document to show the aspects of the architecture that require securing. You will then specify the identity management approach that is required. 

It is important that you should be able to justify your choices as a team, and you are encouraged to use references from Microsoft such as Microsoft documentation, or blogs from Microsoft to provide evidence that supports your choices.

At the end of this lab, you will have defined:

1. Defense in Depth Security Approach
1. Identity Management

>**Resources**: As well as the using the course case study for this lab, you use also use resources such a [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com), the [Azure Reference Architecture Site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/) and the [Microsoft Customer Stories Site](https://customers.microsoft.com/) to help inform you in answering questions in this lab.

## Exercise 1: Defense in Depth Security Approach

**Group exercise**
  
1. From the case study, identify the security requirements that are required by AdventureWorks.

1. List any additional security requirements that should be covered and have been missed by AdventureWorks.

### Task 1: 📄 List the security requirements for AdventureWorks

1. From your machine, open up the file [DP-201-Lab04_Ex01_Ta01.docx](../Labfiles/Starter/DP-201.4/DP-201-Lab04_Ex01_Ta01.docx)

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** discussing and listing the security requirements for AdventureWorks. Evidence should be provided from the case study.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created a Microsoft Word document that shows security requirements for AdventureWorks.

### Task 2: 📄 List any additional security requirements that should be covered

1. In the file you have just created, spend **15 minutes** listing additional security requirements that should be covered by AdventureWorks

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have added to the Microsoft Word document that shows security requirements for AdventureWorks.

## Exercise 2: Identity Management

**Group exercise**
  
1. Define the primary authentication mechanism for each technology used to meet AdventureWorks requirements.

### Task 1: 📄 Define the primary authentication mechanism for each technology used to meet AdventureWorks requirements.

1. From your machine, open up the file [DP-201.4/DP-201-Lab04_Ex02_Ta01.docx](../Labfiles/Starter/DP-201.4/DP-201-Lab04_Ex02_Ta01.docx)

1. As a group, spend **20 minutes** listing the primary authentication mechanism for each technology used to meet AdventureWorks requirements as per the case study.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you will create a of the primary authentication mechanism for each technology for each of the AdventureWorks requirements.

## Lab Review

After approximately 50 minutes, the instructor will bring a close to this lab. The class will discuss the findings of each group.
